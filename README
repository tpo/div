Div
===

The 'div' method renders your partial within an HTML 'div' tag.
Additionally the 'id' of the 'div' is set to the name of the partial.

If the partial is meant to be reused multiple times inside an HTML
document then 'div' can be told so, whereupon it will put the partial's
name into the element's class instead.


Examples
========

* A 'div' representing a unique element of a page.

Given a view with the following line:

  <%= div "sidebar" %>


And a partial "_sidebar.html.erb" containing:

  link_to "Usage", usage_path()


You'll get the following HTML output:

  <div id='sidebar'>
    <a href="/usage">Usage</a>
  </div>


* A 'div' representing a reusable element of a page.

  <%= div "logo", :reuse => true %>


With the partial "_logo.html.erb" containing:

  link_to( image_tag("logo.png"), "/" )


Will generate:

  <div class='logo'>
    <a href="/"><img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" /></a>
  </div>
